The Psychology Club hosted a recent event titled "Careers in Clinical Psychology" during which our own Professor Stephanie Jarvi Steele moderated a discussion with four clinical psychologists. This panel answered many burning questions that students have about pursuing careers in clinical psychology, from what to do as an undergraduate to what a "day in the life" looks like for these psychologists.
