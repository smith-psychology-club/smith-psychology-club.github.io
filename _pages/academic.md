## How to declare a major/minor
There are two primary ways to declare:
1. Ask one of your Psychology instructors to be your adviser
    - Some professors may be at advisee capacity and unable to take you on at that time. Don't be intimidated to ask and don't take it personally if they say no!
3. Contact the Psychology Department Assistant Laura Fountain-Cincotta (lfountaincincotta@smith.edu) asking to be paired with an adviser

## Honors Thesis in Psychology

The departmental honors thesis is for senior psychology majors interested in conducting independent research on a particular topic. Honors students work closely with a faculty member to conceptualize, design, and conduct an empirical research project.

Please note: faculty members from outside the Smith Psychology department are not eligible to serve as thesis advisers; the principal adviser of a psychology honors thesis must be a Smith Psychology Department faculty member. 

The project culminates in a paper that is equivalent to a publishable journal article in quality and length (i.e., about 30-50 pages of text and written in APA style). At the end of the academic year, Honors students present their projects to the department as a whole. Successful completion of an Honors thesis leads to departmental honors upon graduation.
