## How to declare a major/minor
There are two primary ways to declare:
1. Ask one of your Psychology instructors to be your adviser
    - Some professors may be at advisee capacity and unable to take you on at that time. Don't be intimidated to ask and don't take it personally if they say no!
3. Contact the Psychology Department Assistant Laura Fountain-Cincotta (lfountaincincotta@smith.edu) asking to be paired with an adviser

## Special Studies in Psychology 
A special studies is a course you design with a Smith for 5c faculty member and is open by instructor permission. Special studies are typically 2-4 credits in one semester. Students usually pursue these credits after taking a course with a faculty member and finding that they are interested in exploring more about a particular topic. Some students may complete a special studies as part of an ongoing research project with a faculty member. 

## Honors Thesis in Psychology

The departmental honors thesis is for senior psychology majors interested in conducting independent research on a particular topic. Honors students work closely with a faculty member to conceptualize, design, and conduct an empirical research project.

Please note: faculty members from outside the Smith Psychology department are not eligible to serve as thesis advisers; the principal adviser of a psychology honors thesis must be a Smith Psychology Department faculty member. 

The project culminates in a paper that is equivalent to a publishable journal article in quality and length (i.e., about 30-50 pages of text and written in APA style). At the end of the academic year, Honors students present their projects to the department as a whole. Successful completion of an Honors thesis leads to departmental honors upon graduation.

Visit the official [Smith College Website](https://www.smith.edu/academics/class-deans/departmental-honors) for FAQ about Honors Theses across departments.

## Diagnostic Manuals

According to the the [Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP)](https://www.ranzcp.org/clinical-guidelines-publications/clinical-guidelines-publications-library/diagnostic-manuals), there are two diagnostic manuals commonly used in psychology as of 2025: the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition, Text Revised* (DSM-5-TR) and the *International Classification of Diseases, 11th Edition, Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements* (ICD-11 CDDR). 

### DSM-5-TR

Published by the American Psychiatric Association in March 2022, the DSM-5-TR covers all categories of mental disorders for children, adolescents, and adults. This is a diagnostic manual primarily used in the United States. However, several journal articles have noted that the DSM system is used in research and as an alternative diagnostic classification system worldwide. 

With a Smith College email address, you can access a copy of the [DSM-5-TR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/161B-Odz0MJycEiSoDp8UA-EaJFWlBOGY/view?usp=sharing) for your perusal.

### ICD-11 CDDR

Approved by the 72nd World Health Assembly in May 2019 and released in January 2022, the ICD-11 CDDR provides clinically useful information on mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders for professionals in international healthcare settings. Even though the ICD-11 CDDR will not be used as often as the DSM-5-TR during your time here in the United States, Smith psychology students must embrace their identities as global citizens and remain aware of what is used in other countries.

With a Smith College email address, you can access a copy of the [ICD-11 CDDR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P0iaOi_-6I9YSyVBBq3JM7a0FKhQo3tf/view?usp=sharing) for your perusal.

In addition to the diagnostic manual, there is also the *ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics* (ICD MMS). This includes brief descriptions and the insurance codes of all internationally recognized physical and psychological disorders.
